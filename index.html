      <h1>Istanbul, Turkey 2021</h1>
      <h2> Rana Abougoash, 2022</h2>
      <p class="a">Taking photos has always been so important to me, such as when I'm on vacation. Even the most mundane things that I find interesting I want to capture so I wonâ€™t forget. This collection of photos are from when I spent my time in Istanbul, Turkey. I was very interested in the idea of glitch art  as well as the playful  and nostalgic colors always being used by an artist named Angela Yuen. I combined these both with the use of pixel arrays which allowed me to manipulate the colors within the images. I chose to go about this in a completely random fashion trying to see the different outcomes of colors and generally whatever looked interesting to me. This collection allowed me to develop new memories alongside my old ones.
